//! This library contains all Rust's FragmentColor examples.
//!
//! Run them from the root Workspace directory with:
//! `cargo run --example <example_name>`
//!
//! The reason there are two nested `examples` folders
//! is because "examples" is a reserved folder name in
//! Cargo. Because our "root" example contains JS + Py
//! code, we need to have a separate folder for Rust.
