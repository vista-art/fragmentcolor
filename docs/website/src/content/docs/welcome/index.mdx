**FragmentColor** is a cross-platform GPU programming library implemented in Rust and [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs).

It has bindings for **Javascript**, **Python**, **Swift**, and **Kotlin**
and targets each platform's native graphics API: **Vulkan**, **Metal**, **DirectX**, **OpenGL**, **WebGL**, or **WebGPU**.\
See [Platform Support](/welcome/platforms) for details.

The API encourages a simple shader composition workflow. You can use **WGSL** or **GLSL** shaders
as the source of truth for visual consistency across platforms, while avoiding
the boilerplate needed to make modern GPU rendering work.

Check the [Documentation](/welcome) and the [API Reference](/api) for more information.

<Aside type="caution" title="This library is its early days of development.">
The API is subject to frequent changes in minor versions. Documentation is not in sync.

Follow the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/vista-art/fragmentcolor) to stay tuned on the latest updates.
