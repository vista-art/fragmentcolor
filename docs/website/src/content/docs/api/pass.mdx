## Description

The **Pass** object is a collection of [Shader](/api/shader) objects that are rendered to a [Target](/api/target).

While the Shader represents a single **Render Pipeline** or a **Compute Pipeline**,
the Pass can be used to draw multiple Shaders in sequence,
for example when you have multiple objects in a scene
with different materials.

The Pass represents a single RenderPass or a ComputePass in the WebGPU API.

The constructor creates a RenderPass by default. To create a ComputePass, you must call `Pass.compute()`.

After creation, it will only accept a compatible Shader object. If you try to add a Compute Shader to a Render Pass or vice-versa,
it won't add the shader to its internal list and log a warning message in the console.

## Example

```js
import { Shader, Pass, Renderer } from "fragmentcolor";

let renderer = new Renderer();

const object1 = new Shader("example1.wgsl");
const object2 = new Shader("example2.wgsl");

const pass = new Pass("Single Pass");
pass.add_shader(object1);
pass.add_shader(object2);

let image = renderer.render(pass);
```

## Methods

- #### constructor(name: string)

  Creates a new Pass object. The name is optional and is used for debugging purposes.

- #### add_shader(shader: Shader)

  Adds a Shader object to the Pass.
