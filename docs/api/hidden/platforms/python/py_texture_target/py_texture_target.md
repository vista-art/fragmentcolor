# PyTextureTarget

Python wrapper around the headless [TextureTarget](https://fragmentcolor.org/api/targets/texturetarget). It implements the [Target](https://fragmentcolor.org/api/core/target) interface and is returned by `Renderer.create_texture_target(...)` in Python.

Use this when you need an offscreen render target to read back pixels or render without a window.

## Example

```rust
// Python-only wrapper around TextureTarget.
// No direct Rust example is applicable here.
```
