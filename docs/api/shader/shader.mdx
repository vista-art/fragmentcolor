## Description

The **Shader** object is the main building block in FragmentColor.

It takes a WGSL or GLSL shader source as input, parses it, validates it, and exposes the uniforms as keys.

To draw your shader, you must use your Shader instance as input to a Renderer.

You can compose Shader instances into a Pass object to create more complex rendering pipelines.

You can also create renderings with multiple Render Passes by using multiple Pass instances to a Frame object.

## Example

```js
import { Shader } from "fragmentcolor";

const circle = new Shader("circle.wgsl");
circle.set("circle.radius", 200.0);
circle.set("circle.color", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8]);
circle.set("circle.border", 20.0);
```

## Methods

- #### constructor(source: string)

  Creates a new Shader instance from the given source string, file path, or URL.

  If an exception occurs during parsing, the error message will indicate the location of the error.

  If the initial source validation passes, the shader is guaranteed to work on the GPU. All uniforms are initialized to their default zero values.

- #### set(key: string, value: any)

  Sets the value of the uniform identified by the given key.

  If the key does not exist or the value format is incorrect, the `set` method throws an exception. The shader remains valid, and if the exception is caught, the shader can still be used with the renderer.

- #### get(key: string) -> any

  Returns the current value of the uniform identified by the given key.

- #### list_uniforms() -> [string]

  Returns a list of all uniform names in the Shader (excluding struct fields).

- #### list_keys() -> [string]

  Returns a list of all keys in the Shader, including uniform names and struct fields using the dot notation.
