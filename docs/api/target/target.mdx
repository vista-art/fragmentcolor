## Description

The [Target](https://fragmentcolor.org/api/target) object is a rendering destination.

It contains the GPU surface texture attached to a HTML Canvas or a platform-specific Window.

The constructor for a **Target** is private. You must create it with the `create_target` method from the [Renderer](https://fragmentcolor.org/api/renderer).

## Example

```js
import { FragmentColor } from "fragmentcolor";

const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const renderer = new Renderer()
const target = renderer.createTarget(canvas);

renderer.render(canvas, target);
```

## Methods

- #### constructor( [platform-specific surface reference] )

  The constructor for **Target** is private. You must create it with the `init` function in [FragmentColor](/api/fragmentcolor).

- #### size() -> [width, height]

  Returns the size of the target in pixels.

- #### resize(width: number, height: number)

  Resizes the target to the given width and height in pixels.
  This method is useful for resizing the Target when the canvas is resized.
