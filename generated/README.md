# Automatically Generated Files

This folder contains files that are automatically generated by the build script
and might be shared between multiple crates in the workspace.

Currently, it is used to build a public API map to be used by our wrapper crates.
The API definition is located in the `fragmentcolor/api.rs` file.

The logic for generating these files is located in the [xtask](../xtask/README.md) crate.
