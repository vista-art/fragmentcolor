# Architectural Decidion Records (ADR)

This folder contains the [Architectural Decisions Records (ADR)](https://adr.github.io/) for this project.

An **Architectural Decision Record** captures a single Architectural Decision and its rationale. It is targeted at future maintainers of this project to understand the context behind past design decisions.

In general, the decisions in this library are guided by the [REQUIREMENTS.md](../REQUIREMENTS.md) file in the `/architecture` folder.
