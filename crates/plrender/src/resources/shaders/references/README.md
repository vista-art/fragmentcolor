# Shaders from other engines

These shaders are here for future reference when we implement
their features (blend modes, gradient, storage buffers, etc).

They are not part of any current feature in PLRender.

The reason they are here is to test out the Shader composition
module, which came from Ruffle as-is and contains static references
to this folder.

This will be removed at some point.
